# [198. House Robber](https://leetcode.cn/problems/house-robber/)

#medium #DP



## 題目描述

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.**

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police***.

 

**Example 1:**

```python
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

```

**Example 2:**

```python
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.


```



## 解題紀錄

拆解題目+找規律。因為小偷不能偷鄰近的兩個家，所以：

當 nums 數組長度大於2的時候，當前 index=i 指到的數，去找 nums[ :i-1] 的最大值，相加後儲存至 i 的位置。 

```python
# 舉例
nums= [2,7,9,1,1,3]
# 儲存
res_list=[2,7,11,8,12,14]
```



## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) <=2:
            return max(nums)

        res_list=nums[:2]
        for i in range(2,len(nums)):
            res_list.append(max(res_list[:i-1])+nums[i])
        return max(res_list)
```
