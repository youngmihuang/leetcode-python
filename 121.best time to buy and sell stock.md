# [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock ](https://leetcode.cn/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock)

#easy #array



## 題目描述

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.



**Example 1:**

```text
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```


## 解題紀錄
1.使用雙指針：max_ix, min_ix 紀錄最大最小價位的位置，並且當 min_ix 改變時， max_ix 要重新定位

2.需要再以一個參數儲存 max_profit，可以解決測試案例 min price 發生在最後一位的情況

```
prices = [2,4,1]
```


## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n=len(prices)
        min_ix=0
        max_ix=0
        max_profit=0
        i=1
        for i in range(1,n):
            if prices[i]< prices[min_ix]:
                min_ix=i
                max_ix=i # max_ix 重新定位
            elif prices[i] >= prices[max_ix]:
                max_ix=i
                if prices[max_ix] - prices[min_ix]> max_profit:
                    max_profit = prices[max_ix] - prices[min_ix]
            else:
                pass
            
        # max profit 
        if max_ix >=n or max_ix<min_ix:
            return 0
        else:
            return max_profit
        
```
